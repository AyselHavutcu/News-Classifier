# Internship Project

This project covers the creation a real-time web application that gathers data from several newspapers and shows a summary of the different topics that are being treated in the news articles.

This is achieved with a supervised machine learning classification model that is able to predict the category of a given news article, a web scraping method that gets the latest news from the newspapers, and an interactive web application that shows the obtained results to the user.
